Block the annoying and useless stuff at Facebook<br /><br />


Just add the following link to your adblock list and it's done:

I recomend the use of <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a>.<br /><br />

I didn't made this list, just forked it from <a href="https://facebook.adblockplus.me/">AdBlock Plus</a>.
